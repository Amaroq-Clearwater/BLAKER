This is not a joke program but solution of realistic business issues.

## How much data size can be printed on one sheet?

In default 60 DPI, it's about 20 KiB (after compression) in an A4 sheet (this is not a joke).

You can choose the higher dot density, but it might cause reading failure.

## Restrictions

- Up to 99 pages can be printed.
- The amount of printable data after compression is 256 KiB.
- The amount of screenable data after compression is 1.5 MiB.

Do not waste papers. You can virtually print to a PDF file by using the PDF printer.
