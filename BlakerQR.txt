Blaker QR Specification
-----------------------

If the printing method was Blaker QR, then the application outputs
one or more QR code(s). The QR code(s) represent a TBZ (*.tar.bz2) binary
data with some "MeTa data" inserted.

"MeTa data" is inserted at the beginning of each QR code.

The MeTa data is defined as follows:

1. It starts with "MeTa".
2. Two integers (they represent the part ordinal and the part count in decimal).
3. A Base64Int-encoded integer.
4. Each items are separated with ">".
5. The MeTa data ends with "|".

For example, if a MeTa data is "MeTa>01>02>BA|",
then the part ordinal of this MeTa data is one, and the part count is 2, and then,
the A Base64Int-encoded integer is "BA" (64).

For information about Base64Int, see file "Base64Int.hpp".
